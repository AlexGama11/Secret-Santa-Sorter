# Secret Santa Sorter

This is a basic console app that decides who you gotta gift this christmas!

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file you're reading.

← `Main.cpp`: This is the main cpp file, where nearly all the magic happens.

← `Tools Class`: The Utility Class from my OpenGL Project, using it for console colours.

← `Seed Folder`: This is the folder where a text file with the seed and name list will be, share yours with friends so they can use the same seed and namelist, to find out who they gotta gift!.

## I plan to update this project in the future, to optimize it and add more features! Check out my links for news!
